## Testing All Interactions

### Systematic Testing Approach

#### 1. Test Offensive Skills Against Your Defense
```
F1 (Attack) → Test your Defense → Should block and stun/knockdown
F4 (Smash) → Test your Defense → Should break defense and knockdown you
F5 (Windmill) → Test your Defense → Should hit through (Defense ineffective)
F6 (RangedAttack) → Test your Defense → Should block 100% on hit, stay active on miss
```

#### 2. Test Offensive Skills Against Your Counter
```
F1 (Attack) → Test your Counter → Should reflect damage back to enemy
F4 (Smash) → Test your Counter → Should break counter and knockdown you
F5 (Windmill) → Test your Counter → Should break counter and knockdown you
F6 (RangedAttack) → Test your Counter → Counter ineffective, you take full damage
```

#### 3. Test Your Attacks Against Enemy Defense
```
F2 (Defense) → Enable "Maintain Defensive State" → Test your various attacks
- Your Attack vs their Defense → Block + stun/knockdown to you
- Your Smash vs their Defense → Break through, hit them
- Your Windmill vs their Defense → Hit through (Defense ineffective)
- Your RangedAttack vs their Defense → They block 100% on hit
```

#### 4. Test Your Attacks Against Enemy Counter
```
F3 (Counter) → Enable "Maintain Defensive State" → Test your attacks
- Your Attack vs their Counter → Damage reflected back to you
- Your Smash vs their Counter → Break counter, hit them
- Your Windmill vs their Counter → Break counter, hit them
- Your RangedAttack vs their Counter → Counter ineffective, you hit them
```

#### 5. Test Speed Resolution
```
F1 (Attack) → Use your Attack → Test speed resolution system
- If speeds are equal → Both get knocked down
- Faster character → Wins and deals damage
- Slower character → Gets stunned
```

#### 6. Test RangedAttack Accuracy
```
F6 (RangedAttack) → Stand still vs move around
- Stationary target → Accuracy builds faster (~50%/s)
- Moving target → Accuracy builds slower (~15%/s)
- Test miss behavior → Misses should deal 0 damage
- Test Defense response → Defense should stay active on misses
```

## Equipment System Testing

### Overview
The equipment system allows you to test different stat configurations by cycling through equipment presets during gameplay. This lets you see how different builds perform against various skills.

### Equipment Presets
Equipment presets are combinations of Armor + Accessory that modify character stats:

**Example Presets:**
- **Tank Build**: Heavy Armor (+Defense, +HP, -Speed) + Guardian Ring
- **Speed Build**: Light Armor (+Speed, +Dex) + Swift Boots
- **Glass Cannon**: Cloth Armor (+Focus) + Power Gauntlets (+Str, -Stamina)
- **Balanced Build**: Chain Mail (+Defense, +HP) + Meditation Amulet (+Focus, +Stamina)

### How to Use Equipment Testing

**1. Setup Equipment Presets:**
- Create equipment ScriptableObjects in Assets/Data/Equipment/
- Create equipment set ScriptableObjects that combine them
- Assign sets to TestEquipmentSelector component in your scene

**2. Testing Equipment in Play Mode:**
```
1. Press F1 (Enemy attacks repeatedly)
2. Press ] to cycle to Tank Build
3. Observe: You should take less damage
4. Press ] again to cycle to Speed Build
5. Observe: You move faster but take more damage
6. Press \ to remove all equipment (reset to base stats)
```

**3. Testing Different Builds Against Skills:**

**Tank Build vs Rapid Attacks:**
```
1. ] → Cycle to Tank Build (high defense, high HP)
2. F1 → Enemy repeats Attack
3. Set Repeat Delay to 0.5s (rapid attacks)
4. F8 → Enable Infinite Stamina
5. Result: Should survive much longer than other builds
```

**Speed Build vs Smash:**
```
1. ] → Cycle to Speed Build (high speed, low defense)
2. F4 → Enemy repeats Smash
3. F9 → Enable Movement
4. Result: Should be able to kite and avoid Smash more easily
```

**Glass Cannon vs Defense:**
```
1. ] → Cycle to Glass Cannon (high strength, low stamina)
2. F2 → Enemy repeats Defense
3. Result: Your attacks should deal more damage but stamina drains faster
```

### Equipment Stat Bonuses

Equipment modifies these stats:
- **Strength**: Increases damage dealt
- **Dexterity**: Increases movement speed
- **Physical Defense**: Reduces damage taken
- **Focus**: Improves status effect resistance, increases stamina pool
- **Max Health**: Direct HP increase
- **Max Stamina**: Direct stamina increase
- **Movement Speed**: Direct speed increase

### Testing Strategy

**Compare Builds Side-by-Side:**
1. Start combat with base stats (\ to remove equipment)
2. Note performance (time to defeat, damage taken, etc.)
3. Press ] to equip Tank Build
4. Restart combat (same scenario)
5. Compare results

**Find Optimal Build for Scenarios:**
- Which build survives longest against F1 (Attack spam)?
- Which build can kite F4 (Smash) most effectively?
- Which build handles F6 (RangedAttack) best?
- Which build has best stamina management?

## Advanced Usage

### Testing Defensive State Maintenance

**Scenario:** You want to test how your Attack works against an enemy that continuously stays in Defense.

1. Press F2 (Enemy repeats Defense)
2. In Inspector, enable "Maintain Defensive State"
3. Set "Repeat Delay" to 0.3s (fast re-entry)
4. Enemy will now constantly stay in Defense Waiting state
5. Test your various skills against this persistent defense

### Testing Rapid Fire Attacks

**Scenario:** You want to pressure test your defenses with rapid enemy attacks.

1. Press F1 (Enemy repeats Attack)
2. Set "Repeat Delay" to 0.5s (fast attacks)
3. Disable "Add Random Delay" (consistent timing)
4. Enable "Infinite Stamina" (never stop attacking)
5. Test your Defense/Counter skills under pressure

### Testing Ranged Accuracy System

**Scenario:** You want to verify ranged attacks work correctly at different distances and movement states.

1. Press F6 (Enemy repeats RangedAttack)
2. Disable "Skip Ranged Aiming" (realistic accuracy)
3. Set "Repeat Delay" to 2.0s (time to observe)
4. Test by:
   - Standing still → High accuracy hits
   - Moving → Lower accuracy, more misses
   - Different distances → Verify accuracy changes

### Testing Stamina Depletion

**Scenario:** You want to test realistic combat with stamina limits.

1. Choose any offensive skill (F1, F4, F5, F6)
2. Disable "Infinite Stamina"
3. Set "Repeat Delay" to 0.5s (fast repetition)
4. Enemy will eventually run out of stamina and can't attack
5. Test how combat feels with limited resources

## Troubleshooting

### Attack Skill Not Working
**Problem:** Enemy executes other skills but Attack doesn't trigger interactions.
**Solution:** This was fixed in TestRepeaterAI.cs by adding ExecuteInstantAttack() method. Ensure you have the latest version.

### Enemy Not Responding to Hotkeys
**Problem:** Pressing F1-F6 doesn't change enemy behavior.
**Solutions:**
1. Ensure you're in Play mode
2. Check that TestRepeaterAI component is enabled on the enemy
3. Check that TestSkillSelector exists in scene
4. Look for error messages in Console

### Enemy Stops Attacking After a While
**Problem:** Enemy attacks for a bit then stops.
**Solutions:**
1. Enemy probably ran out of stamina
2. Enable "Infinite Stamina" in TestRepeaterAI Inspector
3. Or increase "Repeat Delay" to give stamina time to regenerate

### Defense/Counter Only Triggers Once
**Problem:** Enemy enters Defense/Counter but doesn't re-enter after it completes.
**Solutions:**
1. Enable "Maintain Defensive State" in TestRepeaterAI Inspector
2. This will make the enemy immediately re-enter the defensive skill

### RangedAttack Fires Instantly
**Problem:** RangedAttack accuracy maxes out immediately.
**Solutions:**
1. Disable "Skip Ranged Aiming" in TestRepeaterAI Inspector
2. This is a dev mode feature for rapid testing

## Implementation Notes

### Hotkey-Only Architecture

The test environment uses a **hotkey-only approach** (no Unity UI dependencies):

**Benefits:**
1. **No Setup Required** - Works immediately without creating UI elements
2. **Faster Testing** - Instant skill switching during gameplay
3. **Less Clutter** - No UI blocking the game view
4. **More Flexible** - Easy to customize keybindings in Inspector
5. **Cross-Platform** - Works in all Unity versions without UI package dependencies

**On-Screen Display:**
- Uses OnGUI for visual feedback (hotkey hints, status display)
- Message system for action confirmations
- Real-time state monitoring

**Auto-Discovery Logic:**
The TestSkillSelector automatically:
1. Searches for CombatControllers with "Enemy" in name
2. Checks if TestRepeaterAI exists on enemy
3. If not, disables existing AI and adds TestRepeaterAI
4. Stores reference to original AI for restoration
5. Configures default settings

## System Design Overview (Archived)

### Original Planning Notes

The test environment was designed with these goals:
1. Enable runtime selection of which skill the enemy should repeat
2. Support all skill types (Attack, Defense, Counter, Smash, Windmill, RangedAttack)
3. Provide easy-to-use controls for skill selection
4. Maintain compatibility with existing combat and AI systems
5. Support both single-skill repetition and charge-execute loops

### Core Architecture

**TestRepeaterAI** extends the PatternedAI system with dynamic skill selection:
- Single-phase pattern that repeats one skill indefinitely
- Runtime skill selection via hotkeys
- Configurable delays between executions
- Optional randomization of timing
- Special handling for offensive vs defensive skills

**Integration Points:**
- Extends PatternedAI abstract base class
- Works with CombatInteractionManager
- Uses existing SkillSystem
- Compatible with all AI types (can restore original AI)

## Tips for Effective Testing

### 1. Start with Simple Interactions
Begin with Attack vs Defense, then progress to more complex interactions.

### 2. Use Debug Visualizer
Keep an eye on the debug info to understand exactly what's happening:
- Current skill state
- Stamina levels
- Knockdown meter
- Skill execution phase

### 3. Test Edge Cases
- What happens when both skills execute at the same time?
- What happens when a skill misses?
- What happens when stamina runs out mid-combo?
- What happens when knockdown meter reaches 100%?

### 4. Test at Different Distances
Some interactions behave differently based on distance:
- Melee range (1-2 units)
- Medium range (3-5 units)
- Long range (6+ units)

### 5. Document Your Findings
If you find a bug or unexpected behavior:
1. Note which skills were involved (Player X vs Enemy Y)
2. Note the exact sequence of events
3. Check the Console for any error messages
4. Note any relevant debug info (health, stamina, etc.)

---

## Next Steps

Once you've tested all basic interactions:
1. Test complex scenarios (3+ characters fighting)
2. Test multiplayer synchronization (if implementing networking)
3. Test AI behavior patterns (SimpleTestAI vs PatternedAI vs TestRepeaterAI)
4. Test edge cases (simultaneous skill execution, rapid state changes)
5. Performance test (many enemies, many effects)

Happy testing!
