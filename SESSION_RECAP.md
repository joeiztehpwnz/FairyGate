# FairyGate Combat System - Session Recap

**Date**: 2025-10-13
**Unity Version**: 2023.2.20f1
**Project Status**: Core combat system complete with recent input/timing improvements

---

## **What We Built**

### **Combat System Type**
A **tactical rock-paper-scissors combat system** with:
- 5 skills (Attack, Defense, Counter, Smash, Windmill)
- 17 defined skill interactions
- Resource management (stamina system)
- Status effects (stun, knockdown with physical displacement)
- Speed-based resolution for offensive clashes
- Knockdown meter system
- Weapon variety (4 weapon types with different ranges/stats)

---

## **Recent Session Work**

### **1. Fixed Smash vs Counter Interaction**
- **Issue**: User reported countering player getting knocked back instead of attacker
- **Root Cause**: User confusion about defensive skill activation - thought Counter activated on first keypress
- **Discovery**: Counter requires two keypresses (charge → execute) to enter active waiting state
- **Resolution**: Verified behavior is working correctly; Smash user gets knocked back when hitting active Counter

### **2. Made Defensive Skills One-Press Auto-Execute**
- **Change**: Defense and Counter now auto-execute after charging completes
- **Reason**: Second keypress was redundant - no meaningful decision at that point
- **New Flow**:
  ```
  Defense/Counter: Press once → Charge (2s) → Auto-enter waiting state
  Smash/Windmill: Press → Charge (2s) → Press again → Execute (timing decision)
  Attack: Press → Execute immediately (no charge)
  ```
- **Files Modified**: `SkillSystem.cs`
- **Benefits**: More intuitive, maintains strategic depth from charge window

### **3. Fixed Windmill Charged State Movement**
- **Issue**: Players could move at 100% speed when Windmill was fully charged
- **Root Cause**: Missing `ApplySkillMovementRestriction` call when transitioning to Charged state
- **Fix**: Added movement restriction update in `ChargeSkill` coroutine
- **Result**: Windmill now properly immobilizes player once charged (0% movement)
- **Files Modified**: `SkillSystem.cs`, `MovementController.cs`

### **4. Enhanced Scene Setup Script**
- **Addition**: Added ground plane, camera, and directional light creation
- **Details**:
  - Ground: 20x20 unit plane with collision
  - Camera: Combat-optimized position (2.5, 8, -6) at 45° angle
  - Light: Directional with soft shadows
- **Files Modified**: `SceneSetup.cs`

## **Current System Architecture**

### **Skill Execution Phases & Movement**

| Skill | Charging | Charged | Execution | Notes |
|-------|----------|---------|-----------|-------|
| **Attack** | - | - | 0% | Instant execution |
| **Defense** | 70% | 70%* | 70% (waiting) | *Very brief, auto-executes |
| **Counter** | 70% | 70%* | 0% (waiting) | *Very brief, auto-executes |
| **Smash** | 100% | 100% | 0% | Two-press for timing |
| **Windmill** | 70% | 0% | 0% | Two-press, immobile when charged |

### **Skill Input Patterns**

**One-Press Instant (Attack)**:
```
Press 1 → Execute immediately
```

**One-Press Auto-Execute (Defense/Counter)**:
```
Press 2/3 → Charging (2s) → Auto-activates → Waiting state
           ↑ Can cancel with Space
```

**Two-Press Manual Execute (Smash/Windmill)**:
```
Press 4/5 → Charging (2s) → Charged → Press 4/5 again → Execute
           ↑ Can cancel         ↑ Can cancel
```

## **Core Components Status**

### ✅ **Fully Implemented**
- [x] 5-skill system with charge/execute phases
- [x] 17 skill interaction matrix
- [x] Speed resolution for offensive clashes
- [x] Status effects (stun, knockdown)
- [x] Physical displacement on knockdown
- [x] Knockdown meter system
- [x] Stamina system with drain and rest
- [x] 4 weapon types with range/stat differences
- [x] AI system (SimpleTestAI, KnightAI with patterns)
- [x] Input separation (player keyboard vs AI programmatic)
- [x] Movement restrictions per skill/state
- [x] Debug visualization and logging
- [x] Scene setup automation

### ⚠️ **Known Design Decisions**

**Simplicity Focus**: User wants to keep combat simple and strategic rather than execution-heavy
- No perfect parry windows (yet)
- No active defense duration limits (yet)
- Focus on prediction/positioning over reaction speed

**Defensive Skill Philosophy**:
- Can wait indefinitely (stamina permitting)
- This creates "patience game" - may add duration limits later if camping becomes issue

## **Testing Status**

### ✅ **Verified Working**
- All 17 skill interactions
- Speed resolution (offensive clashes)
- Counter reflection mechanics
- Knockdown with displacement
- Stamina drain and management
- AI independent movement
- AI skill selection
- Player/AI input separation
- Skill charging and execution
- Movement restrictions per skill state

- Smash vs Counter (working correctly)
- Defense/Counter auto-execute after charge
- Windmill immobilization in Charged state

### 📋 **Pending Tasks**
- Performance validation (60 FPS target)
- Balance testing (weapon effectiveness, stat scaling)
- Extended playtesting with AI opponent
- Potential: Add duration limits to defensive skills (if camping becomes issue)
- Potential: Add timing mechanics (perfect parry, active defense windows) - only if testing shows need

---

## **Design Philosophy**

**Current Direction**: Simple, strategic, prediction-based combat
- Skill = reading opponent + resource management + positioning
- NOT execution-heavy or reaction-speed dependent
- Accessible to all skill levels
- Deep through meaningful choices, not complex inputs

**Think**: Chess/Poker strategy, not fighting game execution

---

## **Next Steps (User's Choice)**

1. **Testing Phase**: Extensive playtesting with current system
2. **Balance Iteration**: Adjust stats/costs based on testing
3. **AI Enhancement**: Add more enemy patterns if needed
4. **Timing Mechanics**: Only add if testing reveals need for more depth
5. **Content Expansion**: More weapons, skills, enemy types

---

## **Quick Reference: Controls**

**Movement**: WASD
**Combat Enter**: TAB (target enemy)
**Combat Exit**: ESC
**Skills**: 1-5 (Attack, Defense, Counter, Smash, Windmill)
**Cancel Skill**: Space
**Rest**: X (regenerate stamina, exits combat)
**Reset Scene**: R

---

## **Important Code Patterns**

### **Adding New Skills**
1. Add to `SkillType` enum in `CombatEnums.cs`
2. Add interaction rules in `CombatInteractionManager.DetermineInteraction()`
3. Add stamina cost in `SkillSystem.GetSkillStaminaCost()`
4. Add movement restrictions in `MovementController.GetSkillMovementModifier()`
5. Add execution timing in `SpeedResolver.CalculateExecutionTime()`

### **Adding New Status Effects**
1. Add to `StatusEffectType` enum
2. Add stacking rules in `StatusEffectManager.ProcessStatusEffectStacking()`
3. Add priority in `StatusEffectManager.GetPrimaryStatusEffect()`
4. Add duration calculation if needed in `DamageCalculator`

### **Adding New Weapons**
1. Create `WeaponData` ScriptableObject asset
2. Add factory method in `WeaponData.cs` (e.g., `CreateAxeData()`)
3. Weapon automatically integrates with existing systems

---

## **Performance Notes**

- Component caching in Awake() prevents GetComponent() calls
- Event-driven architecture minimizes polling
- Status effects use efficient list operations
- Debug logs are conditional (disabled in production)
- Update loops only for essential real-time updates
- Target: 60+ FPS maintained during complex combat

---

## **Git Status Snapshot**

**Modified Files**:
- `SkillSystem.cs` (auto-execute defensive skills, charged state movement fix)
- `MovementController.cs` (Windmill charged state immobilization)
- `CombatInteractionManager.cs` (displacement for direct hits)
- `SceneSetup.cs` (environment creation)
- Various combat system files (displacement integration)

**Untracked Files**:
- `AI_PATTERN_SYSTEM_DESIGN.md` (future AI enhancement design doc)
- `Assets/Data/` (ScriptableObject assets)
- `Assets/Setup.unity` (test scene)
- Editor scripts and metadata

---

## **User Preferences & Decisions**

1. ✅ **Simplicity over complexity** - avoid adding mechanics unless testing proves necessary
2. ✅ **One-press for defensive skills** - removed redundant second keypress
3. ✅ **Windmill immobilization when charged** - commitment to positioning
4. ✅ **No additional visual feedback** - satisfied with current debug UI
5. 🤔 **Timing mechanics** - decided to test current system first, add only if needed
6. 🤔 **Defensive duration limits** - waiting to see if camping becomes an issue

---

## **Known Issues / Future Considerations**

**None currently blocking** - system is fully functional

**Potential Future Work**:
- Duration limits for Defense/Counter waiting states (if camping is problem)
- Perfect parry windows (if depth is insufficient)
- More enemy AI patterns (when content expansion begins)
- Weapon balancing (after extended playtesting)
